i cant believe i won,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
its such a slap in the face im your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
monica is ross sister,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
no ross sister was really fat,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
no she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow rachel around like a puppy dog,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
hey amy youve got to stop doing that,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
now see this way you protect the plate and lets face it you have fun,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
okay how about this you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies then do i get the baby,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
no if crazy plate lad sees monica frustrated at this comment if monica dies then i would get emma right,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1
well actually,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
actually what,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
well its just its just in that case then um emma would go to my parents,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
what,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
hurts doesnt it,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
so if monicas not around then im not good enough to raise emma,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
yeah hes lying he looked down,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
well what is wrong with me am i am i incomptent because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
honey youre taking this the wrong way we think youre going to be a wonderful parent its just youre more the fun parent,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
yeah and wed want to make sure emma has someone like monica who is more uh uh discliplinarin someone who can be firm and strict,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
thats not how you see me is it,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
look i may not know a lot about babies but do you really think im not capable,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
no you both are equally capable its just youre strongest when when youre together,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
ok so if we both had emma and i die knocks on table shed have to give her up,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
sure monica would have to give her up,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
i lie better then that right,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
so let me get this straight so my two friends die i get emma then my wife dies then emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

ok given your situation the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy or insemination using a sperm donor,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
and of course if you feel that neither of those is right for you you can always adopt,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
